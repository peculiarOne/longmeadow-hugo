text: "By the grace of God, I was born into a Christian family and accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour at a young age. My wife Leena and I have been blessed with two children, and we moved to the UK in 2021. Since then, we have been attending Longmeadow Church, which has been instrumental in helping us grow in the Lord. I currently work as an IT Engineer, and in my free time, I enjoy playing badminton"
