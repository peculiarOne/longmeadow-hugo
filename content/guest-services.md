### What should I expect?

<p class="lead">
A guest service is an informal service focussing on a theme relevant to your life today.
If you don't usually go to church, this is an ideal time to come along and see what it's like.
We invite you to just sit back and hear more about what it means to be a Christian.
</p>

<p class="lead">
The atmosphere is relaxed, the dress casual and everyone is welcome.
There will be a few songs (it doesn't matter if you don't know them!) and prayers.
Then there wil be a short talk discussing what the Bible says about the day's topic.
Tea, coffee and biscuits are served after the service.

### Can I bring children?

Lot's of children come to our church.
There is a cr√®che for pre-school children and classes for children up to school year 9.
All teachers are DBS checked, and your children are welcome to stay in the service if you would prefer.
