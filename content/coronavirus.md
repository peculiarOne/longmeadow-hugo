 In the light of the recent changes to government guidelines in response to the Coronavirus, we have made a number of decisions regarding church meetings. We want to encourage us all to follow the advice that has been issued, both for our own good and for the benefit of others.

**We will not be holding any central meetings** at church whilst the current guidelines are in place. This means there will be no morning or evening services at church, and both BRAG and Straight Up will not meet. However, we recognise that we still need to be fed and encouraged in our walk with Jesus, and so we will be recording Sunday messages and making them available here on the church website from Saturday evening. We'll also be e-mailing out with suggestions of songs that you can listen to and sing along with on Youtube, so that whilst we may not be gathered in the same place, we can be aware that we are worshipping and listening to Godâ€™s word together. 

During the week we'll also be sending out passages of scripture for reflection and suggested prayers to join in. If you are not currently on the church mailing list and would like to receive these or the Sunday song suggestions please get in touch using our [contact page](/contact).
