  I first heard and accepted the good news about Jesus on a summer camp aged 11, 
  and I've been gradually getting to know God better ever since. 
  I joined Longmeadow in 2017 soon after getting married to Maria, and we now have a young family. 
  I work as a research scientist, and I enjoy exercise, spending time outside, woodwork, 
  and I support the Harlequins rugby team.
