 In the light of the recent changes to government guidelines in response to the Coronavirus, we have made a number of decisions regarding church meetings. We want to encourage us all to follow the advice that has been issued, both for our own good and for the benefit of others.

**We will not be holding any central meetings** at church whilst the current guidelines are in place. This means there will be no morning or evening services at church, and both BRAG and Straight Up will not meet. However, we recognise that we still need to be fed and encouraged in our walk with Jesus, and so we will be recording Sunday messages and making them available here on the church website from Saturday evening. We'll also be e-mailing out with suggestions of songs that you can listen to and sing along with on Youtube, so that whilst we may not be gathered in the same place, we can be aware that we are worshipping and listening to God’s word together. 

During the week we'll also be sending out passages of scripture for reflection and suggested prayers to join in. If you are not currently on the church mailing list and would like to receive these or the Sunday song suggestions please get in touch using our [contact page](/contact).

### Here are some helpful online resources to help you get into God's word during this time

The **Bible Project** are also providing great resources for the next few months – here are their details:

> “As many churches close their doors to help stop the spread of COVID-19, we want to come alongside them to help you continue to engage Scripture. Starting this week, BibleProject will send a weekly email featuring one of our videos, a special message from Tim, Scripture readings, and discussion questions for your family or small group. Go to tbp.xyz/email to sign up for our email list.”

Also for parents, we currently use the **Urban Saints “Energise”** material for Adventurers and Ignite, and they are opening that up to all parents to use with their children. There are many different topics to explore, all with activities, crafts, games and so on to help illustrate the truths being explored. If you’d like access to that website drop us a message using our [contact form](/contact).
