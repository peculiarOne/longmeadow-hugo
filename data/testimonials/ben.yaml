text: "I went to university as an atheist, but when Jesus called me, I realised that Heâ€™s real and alive, and the only reliable Rescuer. In time, He gave me a job as a clinical scientist, then He united me to my wife Elisabeth, and gave us two children. He led me to study at theological college, then to serve as an elder at Longmeadow from 2009. I adore preaching his Word, scrabble, action films and keeping fit."
