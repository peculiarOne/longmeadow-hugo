# longmeadow-hugo
Longmeadow Evangelical Church website done using hugo

## Cloning
We're using a submodule for the theme so when cloning you'll need to use the --recursive option in order to get a complete and runnable copy of the site. So something like,
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/peculiarOne/longmeadow-hugo.git`


## GitHub Actions

### Local Testing

Run the Github Action locally with [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) by running the sript `act.sh`
