## Update, January 6th

In-person Sunday afternoon services have now been put on hold.

We are grateful that in the current national lockdown the government are still allowing churches to remain open for worship services.

However we recognise that in Stevenage and the surrounding areas Covid-19 transmission rates are particularly high at present, and likely still on the increase.
As a result we don't think it would be wise to hold physical services for the time being. We will review this situation regularly and seek to restart in-person services when Covid transmission rates fall.

## Update, December 1st

The nationwide lockdown is coming to an end on the 2nd December which allows us to restart Sunday afternoon gatherings.

Social distancing and facemasks will still be required within the building, but under the new Tier 2 guidelines socialising in groups of up to 6 is allowed outside - so bring a warm coat and hang around for a chat! üß•

## Update, November 5th

With the nationwide four week lockdown coming into operation today we're forced to suspend our in person Sunday afternoon gatherings.

We will continue to gather virtually on Sunday mornings, for prayer on Wednesday evenings, and as home groups during the week. If you would like to join any of these meetings then please [get in touch](/contact). You can also follow us on our [YouTube channel](https://tinyurl.com/LongmeadowLive).

## Update, September 17th

We are now meeting in person at the church building on Sunday afternoons at 4pm.

The Sunday morning live streams are continuing and will still be considered our "main" weekly gatherings, but the afternoons will provide a chance for those who wish to gather in person to do so.

We're following current government guidance which means social distancing will be observed and face coverings will need to be worn within the building. In order to meet safely there will be a limit on the number of people who can attend and we'll be running a pre-booking system.

## Update, June 19th

From this coming Sunday we'll be live streaming morning our services on YouTube. Head over to [our channel](https://tinyurl.com/LongmeadowLive) at 10:30am each Sunday to join us.

## Update, May 11th

Though we're still unable to meet in-person there are lots of opportunities during the week to see & speak to others, be taught from scripture, encourage each other and pray together. Here's a run-down of what's happening currently.

## Initial Notice

 In the light of the recent changes to government guidelines in response to the Coronavirus, we have made a number of decisions regarding church meetings. We want to encourage us all to follow the advice that has been issued, both for our own good and for the benefit of others.

**We will not be holding any central meetings** at church whilst the current guidelines are in place. This means there will be no morning or evening services at church, and both BRAG and Straight Up will not meet. However, we recognise that we still need to be fed and encouraged in our walk with Jesus, and so we will be recording Sunday messages and making them available here on the church website from Saturday evening. We'll also be e-mailing out with suggestions of songs that you can listen to and sing along with on YouTube, so that whilst we may not be gathered in the same place, we can be aware that we are worshipping and listening to God‚Äôs word together. 

**We are holding various small virtual gatherings** both on Sundays and during the week; to read scripture together, encourage each other, pray together, and just stay in touch with our church family. If you would like to become involved in one of these groups drop us a message using our [contact form](/contact).

During the week we'll also be sending out passages of scripture for reflection and suggested prayers to join in. If you are not currently on the church mailing list and would like to receive these or the Sunday song suggestions then subscribe to the "Be Kept Up To Date" mailing list on our [contact page](/contact).

### Here are some helpful online resources to help you get into God's word during this time
